# Github

github is the official source control platform at OGP.

## Repository organisation

Projects exist as independent repositories in github. Each Repository should be owned by a team defined in the github organisation.

Each repository should have the following minimum set of files:
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` (see [doc](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners))
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` (see [doc](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository))

Public repositories should additionally have the following files:
- `LICENSE.md`
- `CREDITS.md`
- `.github/issue_template.md` (see [doc](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository))
